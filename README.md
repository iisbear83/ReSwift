Swift Flow is a [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux)-like implementation of the unidirectional data flow architecture in Swift.

#Getting Started Guide

[A Getting Started Guide that describes the core components of apps built with Swift Flow lives here](Readme/GettingStarted.md). It will be expanded in the next few weeks. To get an understanding of the core principles I recommend reading the brilliant [redux documentation](http://rackt.org/redux/).

#Installation

You can install SwiftFlow via [Carthage]() by adding the following line to your Cartfile:

	github "Swift-Flow/Swift-Flow"
	
#Extensions

This repository contains the core component for Swift Flow, the following extensions are available:

- [Swift-Flow-Router](https://github.com/Swift-Flow/Swift-Flow-Router): Provides a SwiftFlow compatible Router that allows declarative routing in iOS applications
- [Swift-Flow-Recorder](https://github.com/Swift-Flow/Swift-Flow-Recorder): Provides a `Store` implementation that records all `Action`s and allows for hot-reloading and time travel

#Example Projects

- [CounterExample](https://github.com/Swift-Flow/CounterExample): A very simple counter app implemented with Swift Flow. This app also demonstrates the basics of routing with SwiftFlowRouter.
- [Meet](https://github.com/Ben-G/Meet): A real world application being built with Swift Flow - currently still very early on.

#Credits

- Thanks a lot to [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon) for building redux - all ideas in here and many implementation details were provided by his framework.

#Demo

[Here's a brief video](https://vimeo.com/149151908) that demonstrates the time traveling capabilities provided by Swift Flow.
